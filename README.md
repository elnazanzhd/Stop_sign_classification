This repository contains the link to my deployed Stop/Not-Stop image
classification model.

## Live Demo

You can test the model here:\
**https://stop-sign-classification-691a22bef0852a2d8976aab2.22sqsnan6tta.eu-gb.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/**

Upload an image of a traffic sign and the system returns whether it is a
**stop sign** or **not a stop sign**.

## Project Summary

The model was trained using a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
built in PyTorch.\
It performs binary classification on traffic sign images and is deployed
as a web service using IBM Cloud Code Engine.

## Features

-   Image upload interface\
-   Real-time prediction (stop / not_stop)\
-   Displays confidence percentage\
-   Minimal UI focused on testing the model

## Tech Stack

-   Python\
-   PyTorch\
-   Flask\
-   IBM Cloud Code Engine

## Notes

This repository hosts the project link only.\
The backend code and model weights are deployed remotely.
